# VZTA TRAILs - Gamified Town Trails Project

## Project Brief: 36 Victoria Mann, VZTA Smart Towns (Near Me Now Ltd)

### Client: Near Me Now Ltd
### Teams: 1-5
### Development Cycle: 4 Weeks (Team 4)

---

Near Me Now Ltd has developed an innovative ecosystem for smart towns, accessible through a user-friendly app. This platform is divided into distinct domains for businesses and councils, enabling them to manage their respective accounts and oversee app functionalities.

One prominent feature of our app is the "Town Trails" function. This feature leverages geolocation technology (Longitude/Latitude) to create engaging trails across towns, connecting landmarks and businesses. Each trail is enriched with images and descriptions, providing a unique and interactive way for users to explore their town.

### Project Objective:
Our current objective is to enhance the Town Trails feature by introducing gamification elements. The inspiration for this approach can be seen in the concept presented at [High Street Safari](https://highstreetsafari.com).

### Key Features to Implement:

1. **Trail Validation Through Image/QR Code Scanning**: 
   - Users validate their trail points by scanning an image or QR code placed at various trail locations.
   - If image recognition proves challenging, QR codes will be the primary method for validation.

2. **Retention of Scanning Data on Platform**: 
   - Scans are recorded by the platform.
   - Successful scans reward users with medals, images, or parts of a story.

3. **Location-Independent Trail Functionality**: 
   - Trails must be operational regardless of geographical location.
   - The system should be able to distinguish between different towns and specific QR codes or images, ensuring that rewards are appropriately allocated to the correct trail.

### Project Status:
- The core functionalities, including the QR scanner and map feature, have been successfully developed.
- Some aspects, such as CSS and layout enhancements, remain to be refined.

### Contribution:
- As a member of Team 4, my primary contribution was the development of the QR scanner and the integration of the map feature.

### Future Development:
- Focus on improving the user interface and the overall aesthetic of the app.
- Explore advanced image recognition technologies for a more seamless user experience.
